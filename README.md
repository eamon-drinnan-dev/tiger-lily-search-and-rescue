# tiger-lily-search-and-rescue
Tiger Lily Search & Rescue is a next-generation search-and-rescue coordination platform. Tiger Lily brings drones, K9 units, mission plans, and incident data together on an intuitive, high-visibility geospatial interface. Built for clarity, reliability, and real-time performance in field operations—from wilderness rescues to disaster response.

Disclaimer: This is the second iteration of the project - phase 1 is private, and was a wireframe of mishmash features to familiarize myself with the industry.
